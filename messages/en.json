            "howToBoilEgg": {
                "q": "How do I boil an egg perfectly?",
                "a": "Place eggs in a pot and cover with cold water by 1 inch. Bring to a boil, then turn off heat and cover. Let sit for 10-12 minutes for hard-boiled, 6-7 minutes for soft-boiled. Transfer to ice water immediately to stop cooking and prevent the green ring around the yolk."
            },
            "howToCookPasta": {
                "q": "How do I cook pasta al dente?",
                "a": "Use a large pot with plenty of salted boiling water (about 1 tablespoon salt per 4 quarts water). Cook pasta for 1-2 minutes less than package directions, stirring occasionally. Taste test for a firm but tender texture. Reserve 1 cup pasta water before draining to help thicken sauces."
            },
            "howToCookRice": {
                "q": "What's the best way to cook fluffy rice?",
                "a": "Rinse rice until water runs clear to remove excess starch. Use a 2:1 ratio of water to rice. Bring to a boil, reduce to low heat, cover, and simmer for 18-20 minutes without lifting the lid. Remove from heat and let stand covered for 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork."
            },
            "howToCookSteak": {
                "q": "How do I cook the perfect steak?",
                "a": "Pat steak dry and season generously with salt and pepper 30-40 minutes before cooking. Preheat a heavy pan until very hot. Sear 3-4 minutes per side for medium-rare (internal temp 130-135°F). Let rest 5-10 minutes before slicing to allow juices to redistribute."
            },
            "bakingPowderVsSoda": {
                "q": "What's the difference between baking powder and baking soda?",
                "a": "Baking soda is pure sodium bicarbonate and needs an acid (like buttermilk or lemon juice) to activate. Baking powder contains baking soda plus an acid, so it works on its own. They're not interchangeable - use what the recipe calls for."
            },
            "essentialTools": {
                "q": "What essential kitchen tools do I need to start?",
                "a": "Start with a chef's knife, cutting board, measuring cups/spoons, a large pot, a saucepan, a skillet, and a baking sheet. These basics cover most recipes."
            },
            "readRecipe": {
                "q": "How important is reading the recipe beforehand?",
                "a": "Crucial! Read it twice to understand steps, timing, and ensure you have all ingredients. This prevents mid-cooking surprises."
            },
            "miseEnPlace": {
                "q": "What is 'mise en place'?",
                "a": "It means 'everything in its place'. Prep, chop, and measure all ingredients before you start cooking. It makes cooking stress-free and prevents burning food while you look for spices."
            },
            "pantryStaples": {
                "q": "What should I stock in my pantry?",
                "a": "Keep oils (olive, vegetable), vinegar, dried herbs/spices, salt, pepper, flour, sugar, rice, pasta, canned tomatoes, and beans on hand for easy meals."
            },
            "seasoningTips": {
                "q": "How do I season food correctly?",
                "a": "Season in layers throughout cooking, not just at the end. Taste as you go. Salt enhances flavor, while acid (lemon, vinegar) brightens dull dishes."
            },
            "preventSticking": {
                "q": "How do I stop food from sticking to the pan?",
                "a": "Preheat your pan properly before adding oil, then let the oil get hot before adding food. Don't overcrowd the pan, or food will steam instead of sear."
            },
            "checkMeatDoneness": {
                "q": "How do I know when meat is cooked?",
                "a": "The only safe way is using a digital meat thermometer. Color isn't reliable. Chicken should be 165°F, pork/steaks 145°F, and ground meat 160°F."
            },
            "saltPastaWater": {
                "q": "Why salt pasta water?",
                "a": "It's your only chance to flavor the pasta itself. It should taste salty like the sea. Never rinse pasta after cooking (unless for cold salad) as starch helps sauce stick."
            },
            "tenderizeMeat": {
                "q": "How can I tenderize tough meat?",
                "a": "Use a marinade with acid (vinegar, citrus, yogurt), pound it with a mallet, or cook it low and slow (braising/stewing) to break down fibers."
            },
            "bakingMeasure": {
                "q": "How do I measure flour for baking?",
                "a": "Don't scoop directly! Fluff the flour, spoon it into the cup, and level it off. Scooping packs it down, adding too much flour and making cakes dry."
            },
            "cookingMistakes": {
                "q": "What's a common beginner cooking mistake?",
                "a": "Overcrowding the pan—it lowers the temperature and steams food instead of browning it. Cook in batches if needed for better flavor."
            },
            "tastingFood": {
                "q": "Why is tasting while cooking important?",
                "a": "Ingredients vary (lemons vary in sourness, salt in strength). Tasting helps you balance flavors (add salt, acid, or sugar) before serving."
            },
            "knifeSkills": {
                "q": "How can I improve my knife skills?",
                "a": "Keep knives sharp (safer than dull ones!). Use the 'claw grip' with your holding hand to protect fingers. Start slow—speed comes with practice."
            },
            "restingSteak": {
                "q": "Why rest steak before cutting?",
                "a": "Resting allows juices to redistribute. Cutting immediately lets juices run out, leaving the meat dry. Rest for 5-10 minutes under foil."
            },
            "boilingVsSimmering": {
                "q": "What's the difference between boil and simmer?",
                "a": "Boiling is big, rapid bubbles (212°F) for pasta/potatoes. Simmering is gentle, small bubbles (185-205°F) for soups/stews to cook tenderly."
            },
            "shouldWashChicken": {
                "q": "Should I wash raw chicken before cooking?",
                "a": "No, never wash raw chicken. Rinsing can spread harmful bacteria like salmonella to your sink, countertops, and other surfaces through water splashes. Cooking chicken to an internal temperature of 165°F will kill any bacteria safely."
            },
            "howLongFoodLeftOut": {
                "q": "How long can cooked food be left out?",
                "a": "Cooked food should not be left at room temperature for more than 2 hours (1 hour if temperature is above 90°F). Bacteria multiply rapidly between 40°F and 140°F. Refrigerate leftovers promptly in shallow containers for quick cooling."
            },
            "frozenVsFresh": {
                "q": "Are frozen vegetables as nutritious as fresh?",
                "a": "Yes! Frozen vegetables are often picked and frozen at peak ripeness, preserving nutrients. They can actually be more nutritious than fresh vegetables that have been sitting for days. Frozen vegetables are perfect for soups, stir-fries, and casseroles."
            },
            "cheeseGoneBad": {
                "q": "How do I know if cheese has gone bad?",
                "a": "For hard cheeses, small amounts of mold can be cut away (cut 1 inch around and below the mold). Discard soft cheeses if moldy. Signs of spoilage include unusual smell, slimy texture, or significant color changes. When in doubt, throw it out."
            },
            "restMeatAfterCooking": {
                "q": "Why should I rest meat after cooking?",
                "a": "Resting allows muscle fibers to relax and juices to redistribute throughout the meat. If you cut immediately, juices run out onto the plate. Rest small cuts 5-10 minutes, larger roasts 15-20 minutes, tented loosely with foil."
            },
            "handwashing": {
                "q": "How should I wash hands for food safety?",
                "a": "Wash with warm soapy water for at least 20 seconds before/after handling food, especially raw meat/eggs. Don't forget wrists and under fingernails."
            },
            "crossContamination": {
                "q": "What is cross-contamination and how to prevent it?",
                "a": "It's spreading bacteria from raw food to ready-to-eat food. Use separate cutting boards for meat and veg. Wash hands/tools immediately after touching raw meat."
            },
            "dangerZone": {
                "q": "What is the food 'Danger Zone'?",
                "a": "Bacteria grow rapidly between 40°F and 140°F. Never leave perishable food out for more than 2 hours (or 1 hour if it's over 90°F outside)."
            },
            "fridgeTemp": {
                "q": "What temperature should my fridge/freezer be?",
                "a": "Fridge strictly below 40°F (4°C) and freezer at 0°F (-18°C). Use an appliance thermometer to check, as dials can be inaccurate."
            },
            "thawingFood": {
                "q": "What is the safest way to thaw frozen food?",
                "a": "In the fridge overnight (safest), in cold water (change water every 30 mins), or microwave. Never thaw on the counter at room temperature."
            },
            "leftoverSafety": {
                "q": "How long are leftovers good for?",
                "a": "Generally 3-4 days in the fridge. Reheat to 165°F. If in doubt, throw it out. Label containers with dates to keep track."
            },
            "washingMeat": {
                "q": "Should I wash raw chicken?",
                "a": "NO. Washing spreads bacteria up to 3 feet via splashing water. Cooking to 165°F is the only way to kill bacteria safely."
            },
            "refreezing": {
                "q": "Can I refreeze thawed food?",
                "a": "If it was thawed in the fridge and kept cold (under 40°F), it's safe to refreeze, though texture may suffer. Do not refreeze if thawed on counter."
            },
            "safeTemps": {
                "q": "What are safe internal cooking temperatures?",
                "a": "Poultry 165°F, Ground Meat 160°F, Beef/Pork/Lamb Steaks & Roasts 145°F (+3 min rest), Fish 145°F. Use a thermometer."
            },
            "produceTech": {
                "q": "How to clean fruits and vegetables?",
                "a": "Rinse under running water just before eating/cooking. Scrub firm skins (melons, potatoes). Don't use soap. Dry with clean cloth/paper towel."
            },
            "useByVsBestBy": {
                "q": "Use-By vs. Best-Before dates?",
                "a": "'Use-By' is a safety deadline—don't eat after this. 'Best-Before' is about quality/flavor—likely safe but strictly past prime after date."
            },
            "fridgeStorage": {
                "q": "Where should I store raw meat in the fridge?",
                "a": "Bottom shelf, in a sealed container/tray. This prevents juices from dripping down onto fresh produce or ready-to-eat foods below."
            },
            "coolingFood": {
                "q": "How fast should I refrigerate cooked food?",

            },
            "kitchenHygiene": {
                "q": "How often should I clean kitchen sponges?",
                "a": "Sponges harbor bacteria. Sanitize daily (microwave wet sponge 1 min or dishwasher) and replace frequently. Dishcloths should be washed in hot cycle."
            },
            "visualCues": {
                "q": "Can I trust meat color for doneness?",
                "a": "No. Burgers can turn brown before hitting 160°F. Pinkness doesn't always mean undercooked. Only a thermometer guarantees safety."
            },
            "butterSaltedOrUnsalted": {
                "q": "Should I use salted or unsalted butter for baking?",
                "a": "Use unsalted butter for baking. It gives you complete control over the salt content in your recipe. Salted butter can vary in saltiness between brands, making it harder to achieve consistent results. Save salted butter for spreading and cooking."
            },
            "freshVsDriedHerbs": {
                "q": "How do I substitute dried herbs for fresh?",
                "a": "Use one-third the amount of dried herbs compared to fresh (1 teaspoon dried = 1 tablespoon fresh). Dried herbs are more concentrated. Add dried herbs early in cooking, fresh herbs near the end. Delicate herbs like basil, cilantro, and parsley are much better fresh."
            },
            "oliveOilForBaking": {
                "q": "Can I substitute olive oil for vegetable oil in baking?",
                "a": "Yes, but olive oil has a stronger flavor that will affect the taste. For savory baking, it works well. For cakes and sweet baked goods, use light olive oil or stick with neutral oils like vegetable or canola oil for best results."
            },
            "wholeWheatFlour": {
                "q": "Can I use whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour?",
                "a": "For tender baked goods like cakes, it's not recommended as whole wheat flour produces denser results. For muffins, quick breads, and cookies, you can substitute up to 50% of all-purpose flour with whole wheat. Start with 25% and adjust to taste."
            },
            "eggSubstitutes": {
                "q": "What can I use instead of eggs in baking?",
                "a": "Common substitutes: 1/4 cup applesauce, 1/4 cup mashed banana, or 1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water (let sit 5 minutes) per egg. Commercial egg replacers also work well. Results vary by recipe."
            },
            "substitutionRules": {
                "q": "General rule for substitutions?",
                "a": "Consider moisture, sweetness, and structure. Limit to 1-2 swaps per recipe. Baking is chemistry, so it's less forgiving than cooking."
            },
            "buttermilkSub": {
                "q": "Substitute for buttermilk?",
                "a": "Add 1 tbsp lemon juice or white vinegar to 1 cup milk. Let sit 5-10 mins until curdled. Or use thinned plain yogurt."
            },
            "butterVsOil": {
                "q": "Can I swap butter for oil?",
                "a": "In baking: Yes (1:1), but butter adds flavor/fluffiness, oil makes it moist/dense. In cooking: Butter burns easily; oil has higher heat tolerance."
            },
            "glutenFreeFlour": {
                "q": "Can I use GF flour cup-for-cup?",
                "a": "Yes, if it's a '1-to-1' baking blend with xanthan gum. Substituting just rice/almond flour alone won't work for cakes/breads without binders."
            },
            "sugarTypes": {
                "q": "Sub brown sugar for white?",
                "a": "Yes (1:1). Brown sugar adds moisture and molasses flavor, making cookies chewier. White sugar makes them crisper."
            },
            "honeyVsSugar": {
                "q": "Sub honey for sugar?",
                "a": "Use 3/4 cup honey for 1 cup sugar. Reduce liquid in recipe by 1/4 cup and lower oven temp by 25°F as honey browns faster."
            },
            "breadcrumbsSub": {
                "q": "No breadcrumbs?",
                "a": "Use crushed cornflakes, crackers, pretzels, oats, or toast bread and blitz it. For gluten-free, use almond meal or GF oats."

            "cornstarchSub": {
                "q": "Substitute for cornstarch?",
                "a": "For thickening: Use 2 tbsp flour for every 1 tbsp cornstarch (cook longer to remove raw flour taste). Or use arrowroot/potato starch 1:1."
            },
            "brothSub": {
                "q": "No chicken/beef broth?",
                "a": "Use bouillon cube + water, vegetable broth, or even water seasoned with soy sauce/herbs. Alcohol (wine/beer) can replace some liquid for flavor."
            },
            "freshVsDried": {
                "q": "Ratio for fresh vs dried herbs?",
                "a": "Dried is stronger. Use 1 tsp dried for every 1 tbsp fresh (1:3 ratio). Add dried early to rehydrate; fresh at the end."

                "q": "Best dairy-free milk for baking?",
                "a": "Soy and Oat milk have protein/fat closest to dairy. Almond is thinner. Full-fat canned coconut milk is great for richness/creaminess."
            },
            "cheeseSub": {
                "q": "Substituting cheeses?",
                "a": "Match texture/melting. Mozzarella ↔ Provolone/Monterey Jack. Cheddar ↔ Colby/Gruyère. Soft cheeses don't swap well with hard aged ones."
            },
            "bakingChocolate": {
                "q": "Sub for unsweetened chocolate?",

            },
            "lemonJuice": {
                "q": "Sub for fresh lemon juice?",
                "a": "Bottled lemon juice works but lacks zest oils. Vinegar can sub for acidity (in cooking). Orange/Lime works but changes flavor profile."
            },
            "yogurtSourCream": {
                "q": "Sub yogurt for sour cream?",
                "a": "Yes, Greek yogurt is a perfect 1:1 healthy substitute in dips, baking, and tacos. Regular yogurt is thinner."

                "a": "Meal planning is deciding in advance what meals you'll prepare for a specific period, usually a week. It involves choosing recipes, making a shopping list, and sometimes prepping ingredients ahead. It saves time, money, and reduces food waste."
            },
            "howOftenMealPlan": {
                "q": "How often should I meal plan?",
                "a": "Weekly planning is most common and practical. Plan on the same day each week (many choose Sunday) to align with your schedule and grocery shopping. Some people plan for 2 weeks at a time, while others prefer 3-5 days."

                "a": "Chest pain/tightness, shortness of breath, palpitations, unexplained fatigue, or swelling in ankles. Symptoms can be subtle, especially in women. Seek medical care for new symptoms."
            },
            "commonDidgestiveProbs": {
                "q": "What are common digestive issues after 40?",
                "a": "Acid reflux (GERD), bloating, gas, constipation, and diverticulosis become more common. Slower transit time in the colon can contribute to irregularity."
            },
            "gutHealthSigns": {
                "q": "What signs indicate poor gut health?",
                "a": "Frequent bloating, gas, heartburn, irregular bowel movements, or developing new sensitivities to foods you used to eat without issue can signal gut imbalances."
            },
            "foodSensitivities40": {
                "q": "Can food sensitivities develop later in life?",
                "a": "Yes, declining digestive enzymes (like lactase) or gut lining changes can lead to new sensitivities to dairy, gluten, or other foods in midlife."
            },
            "caloricNeeds40": {
                "q": "Do my calorie needs change after 40?",
                "a": "Yes, metabolic rate typically slows, so you may need fewer calories to maintain weight. Focus on nutrient quality over quantity—maximize vitamins/minerals per calorie."
            },
            "prioritizeFoods40": {
                "q": "Which foods should I prioritize?",
                "a": "Prioritize fiber (veg, fruit, beans), lean protein for muscle maintenance, and anti-inflammatory foods like fatty fish, olive oil, nuts, and berries."
            },
            "managingSugar": {
                "q": "How can I better manage blood sugar?",
                "a": "Pair carbs with protein and fat to slow absorption. Choose complex carbs (oats, quinoa) over simple sugars. Regular walking after meals significantly helps lower glucose spikes."
            },
            "oralAllergySyndrome": {
                "q": "What is Oral Allergy Syndrome?",
                "a": "It's when raw fruits/veggies cause an itchy mouth because their proteins resemble pollen you're allergic to like birch or ragweed. Cooking the food often destroys the protein and prevents reaction."
            },
            "suspectAllergy": {
                "q": "What should I do if I suspect a food allergy?",
                "a": "See an allergist for skin prick or blood testing. Don't self-diagnose, as true allergies can be dangerous. For intolerances, an elimination diet guided by a dietitian is the gold standard."
            },
            "manageCravings": {
                "q": "How do I deal with food cravings?",
                "a": "Cravings often signal irregular blood sugar, stress, or lack of sleep. ensuring protein at every meal, drinking water, and getting 7-8 hours of sleep can reduce them significantly."
