            "howToBoilEgg": {
                "q": "How do I boil an egg perfectly?",
                "a": "Place eggs in a pot and cover with cold water by 1 inch. Bring to a boil, then turn off heat and cover. Let sit for 10-12 minutes for hard-boiled, 6-7 minutes for soft-boiled. Transfer to ice water immediately to stop cooking and prevent the green ring around the yolk."
            },
            "howToCookPasta": {
                "q": "How do I cook pasta al dente?",
                "a": "Use a large pot with plenty of salted boiling water (about 1 tablespoon salt per 4 quarts water). Cook pasta for 1-2 minutes less than package directions, stirring occasionally. Taste test for a firm but tender texture. Reserve 1 cup pasta water before draining to help thicken sauces."
            },
            "howToCookRice": {
                "q": "What's the best way to cook fluffy rice?",
                "a": "Rinse rice until water runs clear to remove excess starch. Use a 2:1 ratio of water to rice. Bring to a boil, reduce to low heat, cover, and simmer for 18-20 minutes without lifting the lid. Remove from heat and let stand covered for 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork."
            },
            "howToCookSteak": {
                "q": "How do I cook the perfect steak?",
                "a": "Pat steak dry and season generously with salt and pepper 30-40 minutes before cooking. Preheat a heavy pan until very hot. Sear 3-4 minutes per side for medium-rare (internal temp 130-135°F). Let rest 5-10 minutes before slicing to allow juices to redistribute."
            },
            "bakingPowderVsSoda": {
                "q": "What's the difference between baking powder and baking soda?",
                "a": "Baking soda is pure sodium bicarbonate and needs an acid (like buttermilk or lemon juice) to activate. Baking powder contains baking soda plus an acid, so it works on its own. They're not interchangeable - use what the recipe calls for."
            },
            "shouldWashChicken": {
                "q": "Should I wash raw chicken before cooking?",
                "a": "No, never wash raw chicken. Rinsing can spread harmful bacteria like salmonella to your sink, countertops, and other surfaces through water splashes. Cooking chicken to an internal temperature of 165°F will kill any bacteria safely."
            },
            "howLongFoodLeftOut": {
                "q": "How long can cooked food be left out?",
                "a": "Cooked food should not be left at room temperature for more than 2 hours (1 hour if temperature is above 90°F). Bacteria multiply rapidly between 40°F and 140°F. Refrigerate leftovers promptly in shallow containers for quick cooling."
            },
            "frozenVsFresh": {
                "q": "Are frozen vegetables as nutritious as fresh?",
                "a": "Yes! Frozen vegetables are often picked and frozen at peak ripeness, preserving nutrients. They can actually be more nutritious than fresh vegetables that have been sitting for days. Frozen vegetables are perfect for soups, stir-fries, and casseroles."
            },
            "cheeseGoneBad": {
                "q": "How do I know if cheese has gone bad?",
                "a": "For hard cheeses, small amounts of mold can be cut away (cut 1 inch around and below the mold). Discard soft cheeses if moldy. Signs of spoilage include unusual smell, slimy texture, or significant color changes. When in doubt, throw it out."
            },
            "restMeatAfterCooking": {
                "q": "Why should I rest meat after cooking?",
                "a": "Resting allows muscle fibers to relax and juices to redistribute throughout the meat. If you cut immediately, juices run out onto the plate. Rest small cuts 5-10 minutes, larger roasts 15-20 minutes, tented loosely with foil."
            },
            "butterSaltedOrUnsalted": {
                "q": "Should I use salted or unsalted butter for baking?",
                "a": "Use unsalted butter for baking. It gives you complete control over the salt content in your recipe. Salted butter can vary in saltiness between brands, making it harder to achieve consistent results. Save salted butter for spreading and cooking."
            },
            "freshVsDriedHerbs": {
                "q": "How do I substitute dried herbs for fresh?",
                "a": "Use one-third the amount of dried herbs compared to fresh (1 teaspoon dried = 1 tablespoon fresh). Dried herbs are more concentrated. Add dried herbs early in cooking, fresh herbs near the end. Delicate herbs like basil, cilantro, and parsley are much better fresh."
            },
            "oliveOilForBaking": {
                "q": "Can I substitute olive oil for vegetable oil in baking?",
                "a": "Yes, but olive oil has a stronger flavor that will affect the taste. For savory baking, it works well. For cakes and sweet baked goods, use light olive oil or stick with neutral oils like vegetable or canola oil for best results."
            },
            "wholeWheatFlour": {
                "q": "Can I use whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour?",
                "a": "For tender baked goods like cakes, it's not recommended as whole wheat flour produces denser results. For muffins, quick breads, and cookies, you can substitute up to 50% of all-purpose flour with whole wheat. Start with 25% and adjust to taste."
            },
            "eggSubstitutes": {
                "q": "What can I use instead of eggs in baking?",
                "a": "Common substitutes: 1/4 cup applesauce, 1/4 cup mashed banana, or 1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water (let sit 5 minutes) per egg. Commercial egg replacers also work well. Results vary by recipe."
            },
            "whatIsMealPlanning": {
                "q": "What exactly is meal planning?",
                "a": "Meal planning is deciding in advance what meals you'll prepare for a specific period, usually a week. It involves choosing recipes, making a shopping list, and sometimes prepping ingredients ahead. It saves time, money, and reduces food waste."
            },
            "howOftenMealPlan": {
                "q": "How often should I meal plan?",
                "a": "Weekly planning is most common and practical. Plan on the same day each week (many choose Sunday) to align with your schedule and grocery shopping. Some people plan for 2 weeks at a time, while others prefer 3-5 days."
            },
            "mealPlanSaveMoney": {
                "q": "How does meal planning save money?",
                "a": "Meal planning reduces impulse purchases, minimizes food waste, allows you to shop sales and buy in bulk, and prevents expensive last-minute takeout. You buy only what you need and use everything you purchase."
            },
            "mealPrepStorage": {
                "q": "How long does meal-prepped food last?",
                "a": "Most meal-prepped food lasts 3-4 days in airtight containers in the refrigerator. Some items like soups and stews last up to 5 days. For longer storage, freeze portions for up to 3 months. Always label containers with dates."
            },
            "portionSizes": {
                "q": "How do I figure out portion sizes?",
                "a": "A balanced plate typically includes: 1/2 vegetables, 1/4 lean protein (about the size of your palm), and 1/4 whole grains or starchy vegetables (about the size of your fist). Adjust based on your activity level and dietary needs."
            },
            "howToSaveRecipes": {
                "q": "How do I save recipes on Dish Shuffle?",
                "a": "Click the heart icon on any recipe card or recipe detail page. You'll need to sign in to save recipes. All your saved recipes appear in your Favorites page, accessible from the navigation menu."
            },
            "howToSearchRecipes": {
                "q": "How do I search for specific recipes?",
                "a": "Use the search bar on the Recipes page to search by recipe name, ingredient, or cuisine. You can also filter by category (like Dessert or Breakfast) and cuisine (like Italian or Mexican) using the dropdown filters."
            },
            "surpriseMeFeature": {
                "q": "What is the Surprise Me feature?",
                "a": "Surprise Me randomly selects a delicious recipe for you when you can't decide what to cook. Click the 'Surprise Me' button in the navigation, and we'll show you a random recipe with a preview. You can keep clicking for new suggestions until you find something you love!"
            },
            "recipesFromWhere": {
                "q": "Where do the recipes come from?",
                "a": "Our recipes are sourced from TheMealDB and Spoonacular, two comprehensive recipe databases. We curate and organize thousands of recipes from various cuisines and categories to help you discover new dishes."
            },
            "canIShareRecipes": {
                "q": "Can I share recipes with friends?",
                "a": "Yes! Every recipe page has a Share button that lets you share via Facebook, Twitter (X), WhatsApp, or copy the link to share anywhere. Share your favorite discoveries with friends and family!"
            },
            "weightGainAfter40": {
                "q": "Why do I gain weight more easily after 40?",
                "a": "Weight gain after 40 is often linked to hormonal fluctuations, lower insulin sensitivity, and age-related muscle loss (sarcopenia), which naturally lowers your metabolism. Stress and changes in sleep patterns can also contribute."
            },
            "dietaryChanges40": {
                "q": "What are the most important dietary changes after 40?",
                "a": "Focus on nutrient-dense foods: colorful fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Limit processed foods, added sugars, and sodium. Hydration and calcium intake also become increasingly important."
            },
            "proteinNeeds40": {
                "q": "How much protein do adults over 40 need?",
                "a": "Experts recommend increasing protein intake to 1.0–1.2 grams per kg of body weight to maintain muscle mass. Aim for 20-30g of high-quality protein per meal from sources like lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy, or plant-based options."
            },
            "boneHealth": {
                "q": "What nutrients are crucial for bone health?",
                "a": "Calcium and Vitamin D are critical. Calcium needs increase to 1,200 mg/day after age 50. Vitamin D helps absorption. Magnesium and weight-bearing exercises are also vital for maintaining bone density."
            },
            "metabolismBoost": {
                "q": "How can I boost my metabolism after 40?",
                "a": "Prioritize strength training to build muscle (which burns more calories at rest), eat enough protein, stay hydrated with cold water, get adequate sleep, and don't skip breakfast to kickstart your day."
            },
            "intermittentFasting": {
                "q": "Is intermittent fasting safe for over 40s?",
                "a": "It can be beneficial for insulin sensitivity and inflammation, but consult a doctor first. Women should be cautious as strict fasting can impact hormones. Gentle approaches like 12:12 or 14:10 windows are often better starting points."
            },
            "cognitiveFoods": {
                "q": "What foods help with brain health and memory?",
                "a": "The MIND diet suggests leafy greens, berries (especially blueberries), nuts, fatty fish (rich in Omega-3s), olive oil, and whole grains. Reduce intake of red meats, butter, cheese, and fried foods."
            },
            "vitaminB12": {
                "q": "Why is Vitamin B12 important as we age?",
                "a": "Stomach acid decreases with age, reducing B12 absorption. Deficiency causes fatigue and cognitive issues. Sources include meat, fish, eggs, and fortified cereals. A supplement may be needed if you are over 50 or plant-based."
            },
            "adultAllergies": {
                "q": "Can adults develop new food allergies?",
                "a": "Yes, adult-onset allergies are possible, even to foods eaten for years. Common triggers involve shellfish, tree nuts, and certain fruits/veggies related to pollen allergies (Oral Allergy Syndrome)."
            },
            "allergyVsIntolerance": {
                "q": "What is the difference between food allergy and intolerance?",
                "a": "An allergy is an immune reaction (can be life-threatening) appearing quickly. An intolerance (like lactose) is a digestive issue causing bloating/discomfort usually hours after eating, but is not life-threatening."
            },
            "commonIntolerances": {
                "q": "What are common food intolerances after 40?",
                "a": "Lactose intolerance often increases with age as lactase enzyme production drops. Gluten sensitivity and sensitivity to FODMAPs (fermentable carbs) are also common. Keeping a food diary helps identify triggers."
            },
            "heartHealth40": {
                "q": "Why is heart health critical after 40?",
                "a": "Risk factors like stiffening arteries and plaque buildup naturally increase. High blood pressure and cholesterol often appear in this decade. It's the prime time to adopt heart-healthy habits to prevent future disease."
            },
            "protectHeart": {
                "q": "How can I best protect my heart?",
                "a": "Follow a Mediterranean-style diet, exercise for 150 minutes/week, manage stress, quit smoking, and keep regular tabs on your numbers: blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar."
            },
            "digestiveIssues40": {
                "q": "Why does digestion seem worse after 40?",
                "a": "Digestion slows due to lower enzyme production, decreased stomach acid, and changes in the gut microbiome. Hormonal shifts (especially in menopause) and stress also directly impact gut function."
            },
            "improveGutHealth": {
                "q": "How can I improve my gut health?",
                "a": "Eat a diverse range of fiber-rich plants (30+ types per week), include fermented foods like yogurt/kimchi, stay hydrated, chew food thoroughly, and manage stress levels."
            },
            "supplements40": {
                "q": "Do I need supplements after 40?",
                "a": "A balanced diet is best, but many over 40 benefit from Vitamin D, B12, Calcium, Magnesium, or Omega-3s. Always consult a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement regimen."

                "q": "Why is hydration important as we age?",
                "a": "Our sense of thirst diminishes with age, increasing dehydration risk. Proper hydration supports digestion, joint health, cognitive function, and energy levels. Aim for water over sugary drinks."
            },
            "heartRiskFactors": {
                "q": "What are the main heart disease risk factors?",
                "a": "High blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, obesity, diabetes, and physical inactivity. Family history also plays a role, making screening even more important."
            },
            "agingHeart": {
                "q": "How does the heart change with age?",
                "a": "Blood vessels may become stiffer (raising blood pressure), and the heart muscle may thicken or pump slightly less efficiently during maximum exertion. Regular cardio helps maintain elasticity."
            },
            "heartWarningSigns": {
                "q": "What are heart warning signs to watch for?",
                "a": "Chest pain/tightness, shortness of breath, palpitations, unexplained fatigue, or swelling in ankles. Symptoms can be subtle, especially in women. Seek medical care for new symptoms."
            },
            "commonDidgestiveProbs": {
                "q": "What are common digestive issues after 40?",
                "a": "Acid reflux (GERD), bloating, gas, constipation, and diverticulosis become more common. Slower transit time in the colon can contribute to irregularity."
            },
            "gutHealthSigns": {
                "q": "What signs indicate poor gut health?",
                "a": "Frequent bloating, gas, heartburn, irregular bowel movements, or developing new sensitivities to foods you used to eat without issue can signal gut imbalances."
            },
            "foodSensitivities40": {
                "q": "Can food sensitivities develop later in life?",
                "a": "Yes, declining digestive enzymes (like lactase) or gut lining changes can lead to new sensitivities to dairy, gluten, or other foods in midlife."
            },
            "caloricNeeds40": {
                "q": "Do my calorie needs change after 40?",
                "a": "Yes, metabolic rate typically slows, so you may need fewer calories to maintain weight. Focus on nutrient quality over quantity—maximize vitamins/minerals per calorie."
            },
            "prioritizeFoods40": {
                "q": "Which foods should I prioritize?",
                "a": "Prioritize fiber (veg, fruit, beans), lean protein for muscle maintenance, and anti-inflammatory foods like fatty fish, olive oil, nuts, and berries."
            },
            "managingSugar": {
                "q": "How can I better manage blood sugar?",
                "a": "Pair carbs with protein and fat to slow absorption. Choose complex carbs (oats, quinoa) over simple sugars. Regular walking after meals significantly helps lower glucose spikes."
            },
            "oralAllergySyndrome": {
                "q": "What is Oral Allergy Syndrome?",
                "a": "It's when raw fruits/veggies cause an itchy mouth because their proteins resemble pollen you're allergic to like birch or ragweed. Cooking the food often destroys the protein and prevents reaction."
            },
            "suspectAllergy": {
                "q": "What should I do if I suspect a food allergy?",
                "a": "See an allergist for skin prick or blood testing. Don't self-diagnose, as true allergies can be dangerous. For intolerances, an elimination diet guided by a dietitian is the gold standard."
            },
            "manageCravings": {
                "q": "How do I deal with food cravings?",
                "a": "Cravings often signal irregular blood sugar, stress, or lack of sleep. ensuring protein at every meal, drinking water, and getting 7-8 hours of sleep can reduce them significantly."
